Conway's Game of Life - Functional Programmed in Scala 

Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised in 1970 by the British mathematician John Horton Conway, is considered a zero-player game because its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input from humans.

It is the best-known example of a cellular automaton.

A Conway "board" has infinite dimensions -in fact, Conway's Game of Life is Turing complete- so the algorithm avoids using fixed-size structures such as arrays. Instead, each generation is represented by a set of the "alive" ''Cells''.

This solution is programmed with best practice and pragmatics of functional programming in Scala with its idiomatics.
