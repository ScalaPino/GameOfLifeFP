/**
 * Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised in 1970 by the
 * British mathematician John Horton Conway, is considered a zero-player game
 * because its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no
 * further input from humans.
 *
 * It is the best-known example of a ''cellular automaton''.
 *
 * A Conway "board" has infinite dimensions -in fact, Conway's Game of Life is
 * Turing complete- so the algorithm below avoids using fixed-size structures
 * such as arrays. Instead, each generation is represented by a __set of the
 *  coordinates__ which are "alive".
 *  
 *  
 *
 * This solution is programmed with best practice and pragmatics
 * of functional programming in Scala with its idiomatics.
